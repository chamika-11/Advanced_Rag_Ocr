{"document_type": "forms", "raw_text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are a class of machine learning models designed to understand,\ngenerate, and manipulate human language. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data\nand can perform a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as translation,\n\nsummarization, question answering, and text generation.\n\nLLMs are built using deep learning architectures, most commonly the Transformer architecture,\nwhich was introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. in 2017.\nTransformers use self-attention mechanisms to capture relationships between words in a sequence,\n\nregardless of their distance from one another.\n\nSome of the most notable LLMs include OpenAl's GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) series,\nGoogle's BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), and Meta's LLaMA\n(Large Language Model Meta Al). These models differ in their training approaches, tokenization\n\nstrategies, and use cases.\n\nTraining LLMs requires significant computational resources and access to large datasets. Once\ntrained, LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific applications or used as-is in a zero-shot or few-shot\n\nlearning context.\n\nOne of the key strengths of LLMs is their ability to generalize knowledge across various tasks and\ndomains. However, they also pose challenges, including ethical concerns around bias, hallucination,\n\nmisinformation, and the environmental cost of training large-scale models.\n\nTo address these concerns, the research community has focused on developing smaller, more\nefficient models (like DistiIBERT, TinyGPT), techniques for responsible Al use, and frameworks for\n\nexplainability and interpretability.\n", "structured_data": {"dates": ["2017"], "names": [], "organizations": ["NLP"], "locations": []}, "created_at": "2025-07-01T16:40:17.323731"}
