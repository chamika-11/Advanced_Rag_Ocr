Deep learning architectures can be cate-\ngorized into different groups depending on their components. However,\nmost of them share similar modules and mathematical formulations. In\nthis chapter, the basic concepts of deep learning will be presented to\nprovide a better understanding of these powerful and broadly used al-\ngorithms. The analysis is structured around the main components of\ndeep learning architectures, focusing on convolutional neural networks\nand autoencoders.\n\nKeywords: perceptrons, backpropagation, convolutional neural\nnetworks, deep learning, medical imaging\n\nTo appear in\nO.
